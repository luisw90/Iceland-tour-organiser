This project uses Create React App, in Typescript. The backend is not included but was made with ExpressJS and MongoDB.
Add and remove tourists for upcoming tours or filter existsing tours to see who has signed up!

## Concept

Welcome to the Iceland tour organiser, a platform that allows tour guides to manage and coordinate their tours with ease. Designed to streamline the process of signing up and managing tourists for tours.

## Thoughts

A good project to try structuring a database and to retrieve, post and filter data.
