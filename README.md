## Concept

Welcome to the Iceland tour organiser, a platform that allows tour guides to manage and coordinate their tours with ease. Designed to streamline the process of signing up and managing tourists for tours.

## Thoughts

A good project to try structuring a database and to retrieve, post and filter data.
